Apportionment calculator
Calculate quotas, fair-shares, geometric means, and divisors for Jefferson's, Adam's, Webster's, Hamilton's, Hill's, and Equal Proportions methods.
how to use:
1st input the state or who we are going to apportionate to. then enter the total resources, then enter the population, use the appropriate buttons, the add row, delete row, reset, calculate and edit buttons as necessary.
only the 1st two columns are editable here.

So imagine Sir rosal gave a class budget 200 USB sticks. So how does groups james, jyx and lian split this?
so the box labeled as resources to be alocated we input 200.
next, we add rows by clicking the add row button.
Input here is under the  1st column, james, jyx and lian.
Then under the 2nd column, how many students are under james, jyx, and lian. So its 9, 10 and 11 respectively. so those are the inputs in the 2nd column.
After that we press the calculate button and it now calculated how many USB sticks each group will receive based on hamiltonâ€™s apportionment.
Click reset button to reset all fields.
Click the edit button to edit values after calculating.
Same process for the other methods.
